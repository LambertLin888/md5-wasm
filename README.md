# MD5 WASM

MD5 WASM is an asynchronous MD5 calculator, optimized for large files.&nbsp;
It is called using a Promise-style syntax, with 'then' and 'catch'.&nbsp;
WebAssembly is seamlessly used to calculate MD5 values for files above a certain size threshold.

## Experimental!

This repo is not yet at release 1.
Use it for NodeJS only -- no browser support.

## Raison d'Ãªtre &nbsp; (Reason for being)

### Brief Background

Our MD5 hashing was initially performed using this wonderfully simple utility:&nbsp; 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/md5&nbsp;
It works server-side and client-side and was really easy to use.&nbsp; 
However, being inline, it would hang our server for the duration of the calculation, a problem when processing large files.&nbsp;
Our application sees large file fairly frequently, so we built a utility which is *much* faster and runs async.&nbsp;
That is this.

### Highlights

&#9679; Uses Promise syntax for async processing&nbsp;   
&#9679; Invokes WebAssembly for large files&nbsp;   
&#9679; *Only* accepts Buffer or Uint8Array as input; No Strings!&nbsp;   


## Javascript Calls And Parameters

### Usage example

	file      = fs.readFile("./path/to/file.mp4",calculateMD5);           // Get the data any which way you can

	function calculateMD5 (err, data) {
		if ( !err ) {
			md5WASM(data)                                               // Our function
			    .then(function(hash){console.log(hash)})
			    .catch(function(err){console.log(err)})
		} else{
			console.log(new Error("Problem reading file"))
		}
	}


### Superconstructor - BABYLON.MeshWriter()

After MeshWriter is loaded (see below), BABYLON.MeshWriter is defined.  It is called with one or two parameters.  
&#9679; **scene** &nbsp; required  
&#9679; **preferences** &nbsp; optional &nbsp; The preferences object may specify up to three values

	      FIELD                 DEFAULT
	    default-font           Helvetica
	    scale                      1
	    letter-origin         "letter-center"

The call to BABYLON.MeshWriter returns a constructor.  Call it "**Writer**".

## Loading MD5-WASM

At less than 32K, the code file does not justify minification.&nbsp;
It is all-inclusive and has no external dependencies.&nbsp;

### Different loading examples

Use jQuery

	const md5URL    = "https://host/path/md5-wasm.js";  

	jQuery.getScript(typeURL).then(startHashing)

### In Production

HTML tag

	<script type="text/javascript" src="path/md5-wasm.js"></script>

You will find the function at window.md5Hash

### In NodeJS

	md5WASM      = require("md5-wasm");

## Performance and Benchmarks

The MD5 utility, by definition, runs with 32 bit integers.&nbsp;
Javascript uses floating point numbers but performs bitwise operations in 32 bit numbers, converting formats in between.&nbsp;
This means there is a lot of time consumed converting number formats -- in theory.&nbsp;
WebAssembly supports 32 bit integers in native form.&nbsp;
It seemed to the author that a WebAssembly implementation would be very fast; so we did it.&nbsp;

For large files (20Mbytes or more) this implementation hashes the files about 20 times as fast as the utility we were previously using (https://www.npmjs.com/package/md5).&nbsp;
At some point, we will happily perform a bit more benchmarking but this is good enough for now.
